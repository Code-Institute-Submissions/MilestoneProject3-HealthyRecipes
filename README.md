# My Public Recipe List! #

In this project I am creating a python project with flask and using mongoDB as my database to store and update records/recipes.
The goal of this project is simply to get a better understanding of the technologies used (refer to 'Techonologies used' section further down).

## UX ##

In this recipe project I have spent a lot of time getting it all to work correctly.
I have met many challenges along the way when routing and updating new records, but I feel much more confident and I'm pleased with the result.
